If the condition is true the block of code is executed again. The process of execution of code block repeated
as long as the expression evaluates to true. If the expression becomes false, the loop terminates and transfers
control to the statement next to do-while loop.
    -It is also known as post-test loop because it checks the condition after the block is executed.
    -It is preferred when you want the loop to execute at least once
