An array of characters is called a string. Kotlin strings are mostly similar to Java strings but has some new
added functionalities. Kotlin strings are also immutable in nature means we can not change elements and length
of the String

=>String Element : The character, digit or any other symbol present in string is called as element of a String.
We can easily access the element of the string using string[index]. Elements store in a string from index 0 to
(string.length â€“ 1).
    + To access string elements, you can:
       1.Using index: Returns the character at specified index.
       2.Using get function: Returns the character at specified index passed as argument to get function.
       3.Iterating over the String: Using loops to access the characters in the String.

=>String templates : String template expression is a piece of code which is evaluated and its result is returned
into string. Both string types (escaped and raw string) contain template expressions. String templates starts with
a dollar sign $ which consists either a variable name or an arbitrary expression in curly braces.

=>Escape characters:
    + \": for double quotes
    + \r: for carriage return
    + \n: for new line
    + \': for single quote
    + \\: for backslash
    + \t: for tab
    + \b: for backspace
=> Some methods:
    + length: returns the length of the string
    + toLowerCase(): converts the string to lowercase
    + toUpperCase(): converts the string to uppercase
    + get(index): returns the character of the string at a specific index
    + subSequence(start,end): Returns a substring starting from start and ending at end, excluding end index
