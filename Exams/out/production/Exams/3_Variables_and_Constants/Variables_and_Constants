A variable is a named memory location for storing data.
In Kotlin, every variable should be declared before it is used. Without declaring a variable, an attempt to use the
variable gives a syntax error. Declaration of the variable type also decides the kind of data you are allowed to
store in the memory location.
=>There are two types of variables:
    1. Immutable using "val" keyword:  is also called read-only variables. Hence, we can not change the value of
    the variable declared using val keyword.
    2. Mutable using "var" keyword: value can be changed after declaration
=> Data types:
    1. Integer
    2. Float
    3. Boolean
    4. Character
    5. String
