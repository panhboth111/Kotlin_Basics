A constructor is a special member function that is invoked when an object of the class is created primarily to
initialize variables or properties. A class needs to have a constructor and if we do not declare a constructor,
then the compiler generates a default constructor.
=> There are two types of constructors
    1. Primary constructor: The primary constructor is initialized in the class header,
    goes after the class name, using the constructor keyword. The parameters are optional
    in the primary constructor.
        - The primary constructor cannot contain any code, the initialization code can be placed in
        a separate initializer block prefixed with the init keyword.
