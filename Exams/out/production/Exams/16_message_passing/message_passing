Message passing is a type of communication between processes or objects in computer science. In this model,
processes or objects can send and receive messages (signals, functions, complex data structures, or data packets)
to other processes or objects.
    + Message passing can be synchronous or asynchronous.
        - Synchronous message passing systems require the sender and receiver to wait for each other while
        transferring the message.
        - In asynchronous communication the sender and receiver do not wait for each other and can carry on their
        own computations while transfer of messages is being done
