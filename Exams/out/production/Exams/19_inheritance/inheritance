Inheritance is the ability of a class to attain all the methods and properties from another class. This increases
reusability.
    => In order to allow a class to be inherited, "open" keyword must be put in the front
    => In order to allow a class's properties and methods to be overriden, the "open" keyword must be used
    => Types of inheritance:
        + Single-level inheritance: one child class inherits one parent class
        + multi-level inheritance: child class inherits from a class that also inherits from another class
        + Hierarchical inheritance: multiple children inherit from one parent
        + multiple inheritance: inherits from more than one parent.
            - this can only be achieved using interface
