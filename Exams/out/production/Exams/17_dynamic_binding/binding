Dynamic binding is the binding that is resolved at runtime
    + This is achieved through method overriding
    => steps:
        1. create a parent class and a child class
        2. overriding the parent class's function
        3. create objects from both classes, but with the reference of parent class

(In java) Static binding is the binding that is resolved at compile-time
    + Static binding is better performance wise (no extra overhead is required).
    + Compiler knows that all such methods cannot be overridden and will always be
    accessed by object of local class. Hence compiler doesnâ€™t have any difficulty to determine
    object of class (local class for sure).
    => steps:
        1. create a parent class and a child class
        2. create a method in each class with the same name and declare them as "static"
        3. construct objects from both classes, but with the reference of parent class
