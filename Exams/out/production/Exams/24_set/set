Set is an interface and a collection that does not allow duplicate elements
    => There are two types of sets
        - immutable: setOf()
        - mutable : mutableSetOf()
=> to get the size of the set, we use setname.count()
=> to find the biggest element of the set, we use setname.max(), and setname.min() for the opposite
=> to find the sum of the set elements, we use setname.sum()
=> to find the average of the list elements, we use setname.average()
=> to access the elements we:
    + elementAt(index) : returns the element at the specified index
    + indexOf(element) : returns the index of the specified element
    + lastIndexOf(element) : returns the index of the last occurring specified element
