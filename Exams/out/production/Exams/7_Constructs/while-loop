In programming, loop is used to execute a specific block of code repeatedly until certain condition is met.
While loop is preferred when you don't know the number of times you want the loop to execute
=>It consists of a block of code and a condition. First of all the condition is evaluated and if it is true then
execute the code within the block. It repeats until the condition becomes false because every time the condition is
checked before entering into the block. The while loop can be thought of as repeating of if statements
