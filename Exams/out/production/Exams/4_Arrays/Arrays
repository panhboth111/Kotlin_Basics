Array is one of the most fundamental data structure in practically all programming languages. The idea behind an array is to store multiple items of the same data-type,such as an integer or string under a single variable name.
Arrays are used to organize data in programming so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.
Here are some basic properties of arrays â€“
    =>They are stored in contiguous memory locations.
    =>They can be accessed programmatically through their indexes (array[1], array[0], etc.)
    =>They are mutable.
    =>Their size is fixed.
